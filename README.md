My Github account (jlanderson5) was created to be able to post ideas and projects to my own repository. Hopefully the more I learn through my classes my growth will be seen by different projects I post throughout my time in school obtaining my degree. 
 My GitHub repository as of right now it's sole purpose is for my portfolio project.
